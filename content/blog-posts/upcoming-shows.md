# Upcoming Shows & Tour Dates

The stage is calling, and we're ready to answer! After months of studio time, it's time to bring these tracks to life in front of a crowd. There's nothing quite like the energy of a live drum & bass show, and we can't wait to share that experience with you.

## Spring/Summer 2026

We're locked in for some incredible events this year. From intimate club nights where we can really connect with the crowd, to massive festival stages where the production goes into overdrive - it's going to be a season to remember.

Check out our full agenda for dates and locations. If we're coming to a city near you, make sure to grab your tickets early. These shows have a tendency to sell out fast!

## What to Expect

Our sets this year are going to be a journey through the full spectrum of drum & bass. Expect deep, atmospheric moments that build tension, explosive drops that will shake the ground beneath you, and everything in between. We're curating each set to tell a story and take you on a sonic adventure.

## Meet & Greet

At select shows, we'll be doing meet and greets after our sets. It's always amazing to connect with the people who support the music, so if you get the chance, come say hi! We love hearing your thoughts and feedback.

See you on the dance floor!
